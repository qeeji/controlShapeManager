Scroll down for an example GIF.

### Usage
1. Copy the `controlShapeManager` folder to your maya scripts path - typically `C:/Users/username/maya/scripts`.
2. In `manager.py` change the `SHAPE_LIBRARY_PATH` to the path where you would like to store your control shapes.
3. In `managerUI.py` change `SHELF_NAME` to the name of the shelf where you want to create the example button for the manager.
4. *(Optional)* To get the colours working you need to get the images from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/osdatp13h01coz7/AAB9pCYP9uBZRaVRjYKqIk--a?dl=1). Then in `managerUI.py` change `ICON_PATH` to the path where you've saved them.
